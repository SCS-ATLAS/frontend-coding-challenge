# Team ATLAS Coding Challenge

Welcome to the ATLAS team coding challenge!


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before you start:
Please don't fork this repository, as it will be visible to other candidates. Instead, clone it and push it to your own repository.
We will not need access to your repository - you can present your solution during the interview.


## About

In this repo you will find a coding challenge for the ATLAS team. The goal is to test your skills in the following areas:

- VueJS, NuxtJS
- Docker

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your capabilities with:

- **Vue.js**: Building a dynamic, responsive frontend.
- **Docker**: Containerizing applications to ensure scalable deployment.

Your task is to develop a containerized webshop application that performs the following:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch product data from the API defined in the server package (the api path is /api/items)
2. **Product Display**: Show the products on the webshop interface.
3. **Shopping Cart Functionality**: Allow users to add items to their cart. The cart should be displayed only when it contains at least one item.

We have provided skeleton code for the frontend, but feel free to modify or extend it to suit your solution.

Checkout the video containing the final solution. Feel free to improve on it.

## Output of the final solution

> [!TIP]
> Your solution does not need to implement the Swisscom style guide, but we've linked it in the app.vue file for reference.
> Documentation: https://sdx.swisscom.com/

## Deliverables

A containerised application that you can run during the interview. Docker / Compose / k3s / minikube are all acceptable ways to run the application.

## Last but not least

- We don't expect candidates to be experts in all topics listed here. We are looking for a good understanding of the technologies and a willingness to learn.
- Focus on the things you know and add personal preferences to the solution. We are looking forward to seeing your creativity.
